<p>This is my website about myself, my family, my friends and the organizations that I am involved in. I come from a small town in Sloatsburg which is about forty-five minutes from New York City. I transferred to the University of Maine from Binghamton University which is in upstate New York. I am a double major in Communication and Marketing and hope to add a minor in Environmental Science. Although I have only been on campus a short time I plan to get involved in Greek life and the MBS Corps. On this website you will find  information about my friends and family, and information about the crew team I was on in high school. </p>
