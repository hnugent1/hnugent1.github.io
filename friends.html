<p> My best friend Katie I have known since I was two years old. She lives around the corner from me, so we've practically done everything together since we were kids. It is sad that we are so far apart now since she goes to college in New York and I am in Maine, but we still talk to each other all the time. </p>

<p> These are my other two best girlfriends, Amanda and Victoria. I've known Amanda since elementary school and we became very close throughout the years. I met Victoria my freshman year of high school and being on the crew team together made the three of us practically inseparable. </p>

<p> This is my larger group of friends which has come together throughout my four years of high school. We always make sure to get together when we are on breaks from college. I met most of these friends through crew, while others have just come to sit with us at lunch. </p>
