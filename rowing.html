<p> My freshman year of high school I joined the Suffern Crew team. I made varsity as a freshman and continued to row practically year round for the next four years. I met almost all of my best friends through crew and we <i><b>loved</b></i> it. Me, my boyfriend, my friend Victoria and our other good friend Jason even became captains together our senior year.</p>

<p> Beyond high school, I also rowed as part of Binghamton University's club rowing team where I was nominated novice team captain. I rowed there for a semester, but unfortunately had to give it up due to scheduling issues. While I can no longer row during the school year, my friends and I always make it a point to go out on the water and row over the summer. </p>
